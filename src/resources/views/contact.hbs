            Yeti‘s contact us page stands out for several reasons.

First, they offer a beautiful (and on-brand) photo background. It is striking without drawing away from the copy.

The copy is a bit cheeky, “While we’re good with smoke signals, there are simpler ways for us to get in touch.”

            No single job suits all of us, but many of the best ones have a few attributes in common: They pay well,
             challenge us year after year, match our talents and skills, aren't too stressful, offer room to advance throughout our careers, 
             and provide a satisfying work-life balance. Job seekers also often consider whether a position is in demand. U.S. News used these qualities to rank the 100 Best Jobs of 2022. You can also explore the best paying jobs and other more specific career rankings. For more information on how we rank, read the Best Jobs Methodology.

           You may not have realised, or even considered, that all of these different factors go into teaching a single lesson. However, when you take this into account, the rate you are paying a teacher is not actually what the teacher themselves really earns per hour. The amount of time it takes to do all of these out of classroom activities various hugely, but I estimate on average it would be around one hour per class – 
           which effectively halves a teacher’s hourly rate of pay.

            Choosing a tutor can be a difficult decision. You want to find a great teacher and have the best possible 
            learning experience for you or your loved one. So, how do you decide on a teacher? There are many criteria available to help you select the best teacher for you and your specific situation. The views expressed here are entirely my own and based on my opinions and experiences as a teacher. 
            This article covers a range of factors including: price, qualifications, university degrees, teaching

            Payment is the transfer of money, goods, or services in exchange for goods and services in acceptable proportions that have been previously agreed upon by all parties involved. A payment can be made in the form of 
            services exchanged, cash, check, wire transfer, credit card, debit card, or cryptocurrencies.

            Before the widespread use of currency and other payment methods, barter payments were used in which one product or service was exchanged for another. For example, if an egg farmer with a large surplus of eggs wanted milk, 
            the farmer would need to find a dairy farmer who would be willing to take eggs as payment for milk.
