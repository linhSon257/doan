             To be precise: Every student must bring his/her OR his or her book is the grammatically correct phrase. But there are both practical & latent problems with that usage, correct as it may be. His and her is longer & more cumbersome to use, especially as the choice is a common one, coming up all the time.
Furthermore, his and/or her is also always written or said in that order, implying, at least for feminists, both female & male (you see, I have inversed the usual order:), that males should “naturally” come first, an idea offensive to these people. So, we have opted for “their”, which has become acceptable, I believe, for these reasons, as proper English usage, as logically incorrect as IT may be.
